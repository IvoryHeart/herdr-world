## Context

See `proposal.md` for motivation. The current product is a Herdr Web-derived React frontend, Rust
bridge and compatibility crate. Its browser federates separately deployed bridge URLs. Roamgate at
commit `81c506e6135f5f3b47f7042252ffdac0ec2bf679` is a React/Bun Web/PWA application whose service
already owns isolated local/SSH Herdr runtimes, terminal transport, resources, connection profiles,
authentication and updates. Current World visual code lives on the PR 78 line and supplies the
shared World model plus Office, Tree and Graph.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Deliver one coherent World application based on the pinned Roamgate tree.
- Preserve Roamgate's working product surfaces and test coverage while adding World as native
  navigation and projection.
- Preserve qualified identity and failure isolation while moving federation into the service.
- Keep the replacement reviewable through staged commits and requirement-linked checks.

**Non-Goals:**

- A generic provider or third-party World plugin SDK.
- Compatibility with old browser bridge profiles, preferences or Roamgate data directories.
- Running Herdr Web and Roamgate bridges side by side inside World.
- Changing Herdr core or defining a new Herdr protocol.
- Native Capacitor Android packaging in the foundation replacement; the responsive PWA is the
  supported mobile application in this change.

## Decisions

### Import Roamgate as source lineage, not a runtime dependency

The branch records both World and the exact Roamgate commit in Git history, then makes the
Roamgate-derived tree the active implementation. Code, services and assets are rebranded and
released as World. This avoids two installers, two UIs, two profile stores and a private inter-app
API. Depending on an installed Roamgate process was rejected because it would preserve the port and
lifecycle collision that the replacement is meant to remove.

### Keep one Bun service and same-origin browser

The compiled World executable serves embedded assets and owns the connection manager. Local and
SSH profiles remain isolated runtimes with connection IDs and generations. The browser uses one
RPC/WebSocket origin. World does not port the former bridge Host, Origin and cross-origin CSP
configuration; it retains the upstream trusted-single-user loopback and authenticated non-loopback
service model.

### Extend the existing connection manager for aggregate observation

Roamgate currently keeps multiple runtimes but gives each browser one selected connection. The
workspace/Inspector surface retains that focused-connection model. A bounded aggregate observation
path publishes status and snapshots for all ready profiles into a browser store keyed by connection
ID and generation. WorldObject is projected from that store. Mutations, resource requests and
terminal attachments always resolve back to one qualified runtime and never fall back.

### Port World as native routes over the Roamgate store

The current World model and Office/Tree/Graph renderers are adapted to Roamgate snapshot types and
selection/terminal APIs. Roamgate's existing terminal workspace becomes the Spaces experience and
its Inspector remains the host-specific operational surface. World views use the same component
tree and terminal ownership rather than embedding another application or maintaining a parallel
runtime client.

### Rebrand before release integration

Executable names, package metadata, environment variables, service definitions, data directories,
browser storage, update assets and plugin IDs become World-owned before a distributable build is
accepted. Legacy `ROAMGATE_*` and old World bridge variables are not public aliases. The upstream
commit and MIT attribution are recorded in `UPSTREAM.md` and notices.

### Start settings fresh

Connection registries use the World schema in the World data directory. Browser keys use a new
World namespace. Old World URL profiles cannot identify SSH destinations, and importing Roamgate
state would unexpectedly couple separate products. The implementation leaves existing files and
browser keys untouched for rollback but does not read them.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Large source replacement obscures behavioral regressions** → Preserve Roamgate's existing
  suites, add focused characterization at the World projection seam, and land staged commits that
  separate import/rebrand/projection/packaging.
- **Aggregate World observation can leak stale or cross-host identities** → Key every record by
  connection and generation, test colliding native IDs, and reject retired results.
- **World styles and renderers can destabilize Roamgate's responsive shell** → Mount World behind a
  dedicated route boundary and run targeted desktop/mobile browser checks before visual polish.
- **Upstream Roamgate evolves quickly** → Pin and validate one exact synchronization point; future
  refreshes are explicit upstream-sync changes rather than floating dependencies.
- **Dropping native Android changes distribution expectations** → Keep mobile/PWA behavior in
  acceptance, document the break, and leave Android restoration as a separate outcome.

## Migration Plan

1. Record the exact Roamgate source parent and import it on a branch targeting World `main`.
2. Rebrand all runtime and release identities before producing installable artifacts.
3. Add and test aggregate connection observation and the World projection.
4. Integrate the visual surfaces and verify local plus SSH workflows through the one World service.
5. Update operational, lineage and release documentation; do not translate old settings.
6. Deliver the complete replacement as a reviewed PR. Existing releases remain the rollback path;
   installing an older release reuses only the old release's untouched storage.
