## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Consistent terminal window controls

Every terminal window presented in Office SHALL provide accessible maximize and resize controls, including floating, docked, and temporarily arranged windows. Maximize SHALL temporarily expand the selected window over the available Office stage while preserving its current arrangement participants. It SHALL save the complete prior presentation and geometry, including dock or arrangement placement, so the window's Restore control returns it to that state. Resizing SHALL update the selected window's usable dimensions without changing its terminal or conversation ownership. If global Restore positions is invoked while a window is maximized, it SHALL restore the captured arrangement baseline and clear the maximize snapshot so a later window Restore cannot reinstate stale placement.

#### Scenario: Maximize and restore a floating terminal
- **WHEN** a user maximizes a floating terminal window in Office and then restores it
- **THEN** it fills the available stage while maximized and returns to its prior size and position when restored

#### Scenario: Maximize and restore a docked terminal
- **WHEN** a user maximizes a docked terminal window in Office and then restores it
- **THEN** it fills the available stage while maximized and returns to its prior dock and size

#### Scenario: Maximize and restore an arranged terminal
- **WHEN** a user maximizes one terminal window in an Office arrangement and then restores it
- **THEN** it returns to its prior arranged placement while the other arrangement participants retain their geometry

#### Scenario: Restore arrangement positions while a window is maximized
- **WHEN** a user invokes Restore positions while an arranged terminal window is maximized
- **THEN** participants return to their captured baseline presentation and geometry, and a later window Restore does not restore the superseded maximized snapshot

#### Scenario: Resize any Office terminal window
- **WHEN** a user resizes a floating, docked, or arranged terminal window
- **THEN** the selected window changes size and its terminal remains attached to the same conversation

#### Scenario: Use window controls without a pointer
- **WHEN** a user navigates to maximize or resize controls with a keyboard or assistive technology
- **THEN** each control has an accessible name and can be operated without pointer precision

### Requirement: Focus determines terminal window stacking

When a terminal window receives focus, World SHALL raise it above every other visible terminal window, regardless of window presentation or arrangement. Subsequent focus SHALL update the stacking order so the most recently focused window is on top.

#### Scenario: Focus a window behind another window
- **WHEN** a user focuses a terminal window that is behind another visible terminal window
- **THEN** the focused window moves above the other windows

#### Scenario: Focus changes after arranging windows
- **WHEN** windows have been arranged and the user focuses a different terminal window
- **THEN** the newly focused window is on top while the other windows retain their current geometry

### Requirement: Close all terminal windows from view menus

The arrangement menu and the shared Actions menu SHALL each offer the same accessible action to close all terminal windows. The action SHALL dismiss World terminal presentations without closing Herdr panes or tabs, ending terminal processes or sessions, or changing the selected host. It SHALL be available independently of visual entity selection. Its scope and reopen behavior SHALL follow the Close all clauses in the modified Arrange existing terminal windows requirement.

#### Scenario: Close every presented terminal window
- **WHEN** a user invokes Close all terminal windows from either menu while multiple terminal windows are open
- **THEN** all terminal windows in that view's arrangement set are dismissed and the underlying Herdr tabs, panes, processes, and sessions remain open

#### Scenario: Close all without an entity selection
- **WHEN** no visual entity is selected and terminal windows are open
- **THEN** the user can invoke the same close-all action from either menu

#### Scenario: No terminal windows are open
- **WHEN** a user opens either menu with no terminal windows presented
- **THEN** Close all terminal windows is unavailable or has no effect and does not change the underlying Herdr state

### Requirement: Rotate the Graph arrangement

Graph SHALL provide accessible controls to rotate its arrangement 90 degrees left or right. Each activation SHALL apply one quarter-turn from the current orientation, repeated activations SHALL accumulate in the chosen direction, and labels SHALL remain upright and readable. The rotation controls SHALL be grouped beside the existing Fit and Arrange controls.

#### Scenario: Rotate Graph in either direction
- **WHEN** a user activates Rotate left or Rotate right one or more times
- **THEN** the graph arrangement turns by 90 degrees per activation in that direction, with labels upright

#### Scenario: Reverse or complete a rotation
- **WHEN** a user rotates the Graph four times in one direction, or reverses a prior quarter-turn
- **THEN** the arrangement returns to its original orientation after four turns, or changes by the requested reverse turn

#### Scenario: Operate rotation controls accessibly
- **WHEN** a user reaches a Graph rotation control by keyboard or assistive technology
- **THEN** its direction is identified accessibly and activation rotates the arrangement by one quarter-turn

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Arrange existing terminal windows from the shared tab bar

The shared tab bar SHALL offer one keyboard- and pointer-accessible arrangement control with labelled visual choices for Single, Cascade, Columns, Rows, Grid and Restore positions. On desktop the control SHALL sit at the right edge of the tab bar; on mobile it SHALL appear inside the existing ellipsis-expanded floating controls, including when the tab strip is hidden for one tab. The shared shell Actions command menu SHALL expose the same view-wide arrangement choices and unavailable reasons in every view. Each choice MAY be given a configurable keyboard shortcut, with none assigned by default; invoking an assigned shortcut SHALL follow the same availability and Restore rules without sending terminal input. The shell's existing shortcut defaults and numbered Actions order SHALL remain unchanged. Single SHALL show one active window fitted to the available stage, except while a Spaces workspace is suspended by Close all terminal windows. In Spaces, the eligible terminal windows SHALL be the already open Herdr tabs of the focused workspace, including tabs that Single currently hides; choosing another arrangement SHALL present those tabs together without creating new Herdr tabs, panes or sessions. Selecting a tab or focusing a Spaces terminal window SHALL make that tab active. Each visible Spaces tab window SHALL present that tab's Herdr-reported split or zoom layout in Single and multiwindow arrangements, with the tab window owning each pane it presents. The one Spaces Inspector SHALL follow only the active tab and selected pane; it SHALL remain a separate resource surface outside the arranged terminal windows. If its Terminal resource is selected, it SHALL show an actionable focus affordance for the active tab window without attaching a second terminal or changing the selected resource tab.

In Office, Tree and Graph, an arrangement SHALL include every currently visible Inspector conversation on the selected host, including the docked Inspector and a Tree inline Inspector. It SHALL reposition only conversations that are open when invoked. Single SHALL show the active Inspector while suspending terminal presentations in other conversations that remain open under the existing dock and floating admission rules. In particular, ordinary selection of B while A is docked SHALL still close A before admitting B; Single SHALL NOT retain A as a hidden extra Inspector or change the one-docked-Inspector rule. World SHALL admit distinct floating Inspectors without a fixed presentation-count cap; this SHALL NOT change Spaces' existing tab admission. All four views SHALL use the same arrangement choices and geometry rules over their current window sets. Arranging SHALL NOT itself create or close Herdr tabs, panes, terminal sessions, Inspectors or connections, change the selected host or resource tab, or send terminal input. Hidden visual Inspectors SHALL remain hidden and unmodified while Spaces is visible, and hidden Spaces tab windows SHALL remain unmodified in a visual view.

Cascade, Columns, Rows and Grid SHALL be one-time actions on the eligible windows at invocation. A later new tab or Inspector SHALL use its normal opening presentation until another multiwindow arrangement is chosen. Single SHALL follow the active tab or Inspector, including a newly admitted one, while hiding only other windows that remain open under normal selection rules. A Spaces workspace suspended by Close all terminal windows SHALL remain unpresented when the user navigates away and returns to that workspace in the same runtime generation. Selecting an existing tab SHALL clear its suspension and show that tab in Single; explicitly choosing an arrangement SHALL clear suspension and present all eligible tabs in the requested layout. Closing all in a visual view SHALL close every open Inspector conversation on the selected host, including conversations hidden by Single or compact layout, so those conversations cannot reappear through a later arrangement or viewport change. Close all SHALL leave the underlying Herdr tabs, panes, terminal processes and sessions open and SHALL NOT change the selected host. Open all terminal windows SHALL admit one Inspector for each actionable terminal tab on the selected host that is not already presented, without focusing or creating Herdr tabs or sessions. It SHALL preserve existing Inspector conversations and arrange the resulting set in scrollable Grid when usable, including when Single was active.

#### Scenario: Use Single in Spaces

- **WHEN** Spaces is in its default Single arrangement and the user selects a different open tab
- **THEN** that tab's Herdr pane layout fills the available stage, the prior tab's terminal presentation is suspended, and the one Spaces Inspector follows only the newly active tab and pane

#### Scenario: Arrange existing tabs in Spaces

- **WHEN** the focused workspace has several open Herdr tabs and the user chooses Columns, Rows, Grid or Cascade in Spaces
- **THEN** the eligible tabs appear as separate terminal windows in that arrangement without a new Herdr tab, pane, session or connection, and the Spaces Inspector remains bound to the active tab

#### Scenario: Arrange tabs while the Spaces Inspector is on Terminal

- **WHEN** the Spaces Inspector has Terminal selected for an unzoomed split active tab and the user shows that tab in Single, then arranges it with another open tab
- **THEN** the active tab window presents both panes in both arrangements, the other tab gains its own window in the multiwindow arrangement, and the Inspector keeps Terminal selected but shows a Focus tab window action without a terminal attachment or duplicate input path; activating that action focuses the active tab's selected pane

#### Scenario: Arrange all visible Inspectors

- **WHEN** two or more Inspectors are visible in Office, Tree or Graph and a user chooses an arrangement
- **THEN** every visible Inspector, including a docked or inline one, participates while its resource tab, selected pane, session and close/dock controls remain available

#### Scenario: Use Single in a visual view

- **WHEN** several Inspectors are open in Office, Tree or Graph and the user chooses Single
- **THEN** the active Inspector fills the available stage, other retained floating conversations stay open without live hidden terminal attachments, and selecting one of them brings that Inspector into Single under its existing presentation rules

#### Scenario: Replace a docked Inspector while Single is active

- **WHEN** A is docked in a visual view's Single arrangement and ordinary selection admits B into the dock
- **THEN** A's conversation closes before B mounts, A does not consume a hidden Inspector slot or appear on Restore, and B becomes the Single window without a duplicate terminal attachment

#### Scenario: Open another Inspector after arranging

- **WHEN** a user opens another Inspector after choosing Cascade, Columns, Rows or Grid
- **THEN** the new Inspector uses its normal opening geometry and the earlier windows do not move until another arrangement is chosen

#### Scenario: Only one eligible window

- **WHEN** a view has one eligible tab or Inspector
- **THEN** Single remains usable and multiwindow choices explain that another eligible window is needed

#### Scenario: Use the arrangement control with a keyboard

- **WHEN** a keyboard user opens the arrangement control, chooses a labelled placement or dismisses it
- **THEN** focus moves predictably among its options and returns to the control or previously focused terminal without sending that navigation as terminal input

#### Scenario: Find the arrangement control at wide and mobile widths

- **WHEN** a user views the desktop tab bar or expands the mobile ellipsis controls with one open tab
- **THEN** one arrangement control is reachable at the right edge of the desktop tab bar or inside the expanded mobile controls, with no separate mobile tab-strip icon

#### Scenario: Arrange from Actions or a shortcut

- **WHEN** a user chooses a layout from the shell Actions menu, or uses its assigned shortcut in the current view
- **THEN** that view applies the same eligible-window layout as the tab-bar control, or leaves geometry unchanged when the choice is unavailable; the shell menu offers the layouts even without an actionable visual entity selected

#### Scenario: Close all Spaces presentations and explicitly reopen

- **WHEN** Close all terminal windows is invoked for a Spaces workspace and the user later returns to it
- **THEN** the stage remains empty until the user selects an existing tab, which opens only that tab in Single, or chooses an arrangement, which opens the eligible tabs in that layout

#### Scenario: Close all visual Inspectors, including hidden conversations

- **WHEN** Close all terminal windows is invoked in Office, Tree or Graph while one conversation is visible and another is hidden by Single or compact layout
- **THEN** all open Inspector conversations on the selected host close, no conversation reappears after changing arrangement or returning to desktop, and Herdr tabs, panes, processes and sessions remain open

#### Scenario: Open all selected-host terminals

- **WHEN** the user chooses Open all terminal windows in Office, Tree or Graph
- **THEN** one Inspector window opens for every actionable terminal tab on the selected host that lacks a window, existing Inspector conversations remain open, the resulting set uses scrollable Grid when usable, and no Herdr tab, pane, process or session is created or closed

### Requirement: Fit and restore window arrangements

Columns SHALL place the current windows side by side, and Rows SHALL place them top to bottom, without overlap. They SHALL shrink windows evenly below their normal floating minimum when needed, then scroll horizontally for Columns or vertically for Rows at the usable tiled minimum. They SHALL mount only nearby windows and terminal presentations, and focusing an offscreen window SHALL scroll it into view. Grid SHALL place two windows side by side, three as one full-height column beside two stacked windows, and four in separate corners. With more than four windows, Grid SHALL tile every eligible window in a count-based rectangular layout. Its column count SHALL be the smaller of the ceiling of the square root of the window count and the number of usable-width tiles that fit the stage; additional rows SHALL scroll vertically at no less than the usable tiled minimum height. Six SHALL form a 3×2 grid and sixteen a 4×4 grid when those shapes fit the stage, without floating overflow layers. Grid SHALL mount only nearby window shells and terminal presentations; focusing an offscreen window SHALL scroll it into view. Cascade SHALL use the normal viewport-fitted default floating-window size, shrinking all windows equally only when needed to fit its diagonal offsets, and SHALL keep older title regions visible behind newer windows. Each arrangement SHALL use the available stage below the tab bar and outside the visible Spaces Inspector dock, with balanced stage insets at supported UI scales and reachable title, close and dock controls. A tiled window SHALL retain its usable compact minimum during explicit resize. An option that cannot fit every eligible window at usable width SHALL be unavailable with an explanation and SHALL leave current geometry unchanged.

At the first arrangement of an eligible window set, World SHALL capture its previous presentation and each window's available prior geometry, including the Spaces Single state or an Inspector's dock/inline state. Restore positions SHALL return every still-open participating instance to that captured presentation and geometry without reopening a closed instance, changing the current active tab/pane or moving an instance that has never participated. Restoring Spaces' original Single presentation SHALL show its currently active tab unless that workspace remains suspended by Close all terminal windows. A Tree inline return SHALL use its exact leaf if that leaf is still visible, and otherwise use the normal docked overlay. Explicit drag, resize, dock and close actions SHALL continue to work after arranging. Viewport changes SHALL keep title controls reachable; a compact layout SHALL keep only one active usable window and preserve desktop arrangement positions for return to desktop. A selected-host or runtime-generation change SHALL discard the prior live arrangement and restore snapshot with the retired windows. Spaces and visual views SHALL retain their respective window placement while inactive without arranging each other's hidden windows. Spaces SHALL keep tab-window placement separate for each focused workspace and SHALL detach the old workspace's terminal presentations when focus changes to another workspace.

Maximize SHALL temporarily present a window over the available stage while preserving its other arrangement participants. It SHALL capture the complete prior presentation context and geometry, including dock or inline placement, arrangement membership, tile geometry and order. The window's Restore control SHALL return it to that captured presentation. If Restore positions is invoked while a window is maximized, all still-open participants SHALL return to the captured arrangement baseline and the maximize snapshot SHALL be cleared; an individual Restore action SHALL NOT reapply superseded geometry.

#### Scenario: Compact visual layout preserves desktop positions

- **WHEN** a visual view with arranged Inspectors enters a compact layout and the user attempts a menu choice, assigned shortcut, drag or resize
- **THEN** the compact view keeps one active Inspector, explains that placement choices are available on desktop, and returns to the same saved Inspector positions on desktop

#### Scenario: Two columns and three rows

- **WHEN** two eligible windows fit Columns, or three fit Rows, and the user chooses that option in any view
- **THEN** they occupy nonoverlapping side-by-side columns or top-to-bottom rows within the available stage

#### Scenario: More than two columns or rows

- **WHEN** three or more eligible windows fit after shrinking evenly to usable compact sizes and the user chooses Columns or Rows
- **THEN** all eligible windows remain in one nonoverlapping row or column with their controls reachable

#### Scenario: Columns and Rows scroll a large window set

- **WHEN** eligible windows exceed the stage width in Columns or stage height in Rows
- **THEN** every window keeps at least the usable tiled minimum, the arrangement scrolls along its tile axis, only nearby terminal presentations mount, and focusing an offscreen window scrolls it into view

#### Scenario: Arrange visual Inspectors at a scaled UI

- **WHEN** a user chooses Columns for two visible Inspectors on a wide desktop with increased UI scale
- **THEN** both windows fit within the visual stage with balanced top and bottom spacing and reachable controls

#### Scenario: Three-window and four-window Grid

- **WHEN** three or four eligible windows fit Grid
- **THEN** three use one tall column beside two stacked windows, or four occupy the four corners, with usable terminal content in each

#### Scenario: Grid with more than four open windows

- **WHEN** six or sixteen eligible windows are visible and Grid can fit every window at the usable tiled minimum
- **THEN** every window occupies a nonoverlapping tile in a 3×2 or 4×4 grid respectively

#### Scenario: Grid scrolls a large window set

- **WHEN** many eligible windows exceed the stage's visible height and the user chooses Grid
- **THEN** every window receives a usable tile in vertically scrollable rows, only nearby windows and terminal presentations are mounted, and focusing an offscreen window scrolls it into view

#### Scenario: Grid cannot fit one usable column

- **WHEN** the stage cannot fit one tile at the usable minimum width
- **THEN** Grid is unavailable with an explanation and the current window geometry stays unchanged

#### Scenario: Diagonal Cascade

- **WHEN** two or more eligible windows fit Cascade and the user chooses it
- **THEN** each window has the normal default floating size fitted to the stage, each later window is offset diagonally above the earlier windows, and every title region can be used to raise its window

#### Scenario: Requested layout cannot fit

- **WHEN** the available stage cannot hold a requested placement at usable dimensions
- **THEN** that placement explains its unavailability and invoking it leaves all current window geometry unchanged

#### Scenario: Restore after arranging a Tree Inspector

- **WHEN** an inline Tree Inspector and floating Inspectors were arranged and the user chooses Restore positions
- **THEN** the Tree Inspector returns to its exact visible leaf when available, or its normal docked overlay, and the still-open floating Inspectors return to their captured geometry without losing resource or terminal state

#### Scenario: Return from a compact viewport

- **WHEN** a desktop arrangement is viewed at a compact width and then at desktop width again
- **THEN** compact mode shows its one active usable tab or Inspector and the prior desktop arrangement remains recoverable without an offscreen title or duplicated terminal

#### Scenario: Return from Spaces to a visual view

- **WHEN** the user arranges existing tabs in Spaces and then returns to Office, Tree or Graph
- **THEN** the visual Inspectors retain their own placement, the hidden Spaces windows release their terminal presentations, and returning to Spaces recovers its tab arrangement within the current stage unless that workspace was suspended by Close all terminal windows

#### Scenario: Switch the focused Spaces workspace

- **WHEN** tabs in workspace A are arranged and the user focuses workspace B in Spaces
- **THEN** no tab window from A remains visible or attached in B, and returning to A recovers its arrangement if those tabs still exist in the current runtime generation, unless A was suspended by Close all terminal windows

#### Scenario: Switch host after arranging

- **WHEN** a user switches the selected host or its runtime generation changes with arranged Inspectors open
- **THEN** retired conversations and their restore snapshot cannot reposition or reopen an Inspector for the replacement host or generation

#### Scenario: Maximize and restore a docked Inspector

- **WHEN** a user maximizes a docked Office Inspector and then activates its Restore control
- **THEN** the Inspector returns to its prior dock and geometry without losing its resource state or terminal ownership

#### Scenario: Maximize and restore an arranged Inspector

- **WHEN** a user maximizes an Inspector in a multiwindow arrangement and then activates its Restore control
- **THEN** it returns to its captured tile geometry and order while the other participants retain their placement

#### Scenario: Restore arrangement positions while maximized

- **WHEN** a user invokes Restore positions while an arranged Inspector is maximized
- **THEN** every still-open participant returns to its captured arrangement baseline and a later per-window Restore does not reinstate superseded geometry
